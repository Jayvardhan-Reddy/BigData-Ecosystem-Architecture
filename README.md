# BigData Ecosystem Architecture

<img src="images/Big_data_Ecosystem.png" width="100%" height="400">

## Internal working of Bigdata and it's ecosystems such as
- The background process of resource allocation, database connection.
- How the data is distributed across the nodes.
- Execution life-cycle on submitting a Job.

** _Note: Refer the links metioned below under each ecosystem for detailed explanation_ **

## 1. HDFS :elephant:

The various underlying process that takes place during the storage of a file into HDFS such as:

- Type of scheduler

- Block & Rack information

- File size

- File location

- Replication information about the file(Over-replicated blocks, Under-replicated blocks, ...)

- Health status of the file

## 2. SQOOP :octocat:

Used to perform 2 main operations.

- Sqoop Import: 
  - To ingest data from any source such as traditional databases into hadoop file system HDFS

- Sqoop Export: 
  - To export data from hadoop file system HDFS to any traditional databases

To support the above two operations internally a CodeGen is used.

- Sqoop CodeGen:

  -  To compile metadata and other relative information into java class file & create a Jar

## 3. HIVE :honeybee:

It has mainly 4 components

- Hadoop core components(Hdfs, MapReduce)

- Metastore

- Driver

- Hive Clients

## 4. SPARK :boom:

The various phases involved before and during the execution of a spark job.

- Spark Context
  - It is the heart of spark application.

- Yarn Resource Manager, Application Master & launching of executors (containers).

- Setting up environment variables, job resources.

- CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend & Netty-based RPC.

- SparkListeners.
  - LiveListenerBus
  - StatsReportListener
  - EventLoggingListener

- Execution of a job
  - Logical Plan (Lineage)
  - Physical Plan (DAG)

- Spark-WebUI.

## 4.1 SPARK Abstraction Layers & Internal Optimization Techniques used :boom:

It has 3 different variants as part of it.

- RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
  - Lineage Graph
  - DAG Scheduler
  
- DataFrames
  - Catalyst Optimizer
  - Tungsten Engine
  - Default source or Base relation
  
- Datasets
  - Optimized Tungsten Engine

## 5. HBASE :whale2:
