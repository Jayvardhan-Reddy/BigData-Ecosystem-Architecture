<img src="images/Big_data_Ecosystem.png" width="100%" height="400">

## Internal working of Bigdata and it's ecosystems such as
- The background process that take place.
- How the data is distributed across the nodes.
- Execution after a Job submission.

** _Note: Refer the links metioned below under each ecosystem for detailed explanation_ **

## 1. HDFS :elephant:

The various underlying process that takes place during the storage of a file into HDFS such as:

- Type of scheduler

- Block & Rack information

- File size

- File location

- Replication information about the file(Over-replicated blocks, Under-replicated blocks, ...)

- Health status of the file

## 2. SQOOP :octocat:

## 3. HIVE :honeybee:

It has mainly 4 components

- Hadoop core components(Hdfs, MapReduce)

- Metastore

- Driver

- Hive Clients
